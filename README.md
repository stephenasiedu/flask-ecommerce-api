# Flask E-Commerce API with CI/CD

## Overview

This project (in progress) implements a Flask-based E-commerce API designed to manage an online store's backend, handling operations such as:

- Customer management
- Product management
- Order processing
- User account management

The project uses:

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for interacting with databases
- **Redis**: Used for caching and rate-limiting
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment

The app integrates the following features:

- **API Endpoints**: For managing customers, products, orders, and accounts.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controlled via Redis and `Flask-Limiter`.
- **Caching**: For improving response time in production using `Flask-Caching`.
- **CI/CD**: A GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

## Features

- **Customers**: Manage customers with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Products**: Manage product listings with CRUD operations.
- **Orders**: Manage customer orders, including placing and tracking orders.
- **Account**: User authentication and account management for admin and customers.
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limits using `Flask-Limiter` with Redis for storage.
- **Caching**: Using `Flask-Caching` to store common data for faster access.
- **Swagger UI**: API documentation available via Swagger UI at `/api/docs`.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Python 3.11+**
- **pip**: Python package installer
- **Redis** (for caching and rate-limiting in production)

Additionally, you'll need to create environment variables for sensitive configuration values:

- `FLASK_ENV`: Environment for Flask (e.g., `development`, `production`)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask sessions and security
- `DATABASE_URL`: URI for the database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`: For Redis caching and rate-limiting

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-ecommerce-api.git
    cd flask-ecommerce-api
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (or export the variables directly in your shell) with the following values:

    ```bash
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app.db  # Replace with your actual database URL
    REDIS_HOST=localhost
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    ```

5. **Run the application**:

    To start the Flask server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will start the server at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Database Setup

1. **Database Configuration**:

    - SQLite is used by default. You can change the database by modifying the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment variables.
    - You can use PostgreSQL or MySQL in production by updating the database URL in `.env` accordingly.

2. **Create Database Tables**:

    The application will automatically create the necessary tables upon startup if you are using SQLite. If you are using another database, ensure that the schema is migrated accordingly (e.g., using Flask-Migrate).

## Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run the tests locally:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
